We are sending the hit or sink message as part of send_resonse() function
The header included here is self.send_header('Content-Type','text/plain; charset=utf-8') on the server side
On the client side this gets deciphered and then printed.
For example server might send 200 hit=1&sink=C for a successfull hit
410 Gone will be printed if no sink can be done
400 Bad Request if trying to sink at no ship locations and 404 notFound for trying and invalid location are also printed.
